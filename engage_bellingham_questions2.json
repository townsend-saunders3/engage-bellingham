I strongly support the City's efforts to preserve the central mature forest area within the complex, as this forest contains several Landmark Trees that are crucial to the health of our urban environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned about Option 2, which could threaten Landmark Trees located directly north of the Sportsplex. It is essential that the final design of this option takes these trees into account and ensures they are fully protected from any development impacts. These trees are not only valuable for their environmental contributions but also for their historical and aesthetic significance to our community.\r\n\r\nI urge the City to commit to protecting all Landmark Trees at the Civic Athletic Complex, in line with the protections required of residents and private developers in public development projects. Preserving these trees is critical for maintaining Bellingham\u2019s green spaces and urban ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my input.",

I realize there are plans via Whatcom and Bellingham to relocate a Senior Center in the northern part of town in several years, but having a Senior Center in the vicinity of the complex where there are better and more bus stops and next door with the Lakeway centers provides for a better location and services.

    "content": "Don't let design edge out function.  This is a public park's main entrance, so it's important that the sign be easily readable.  Even more so in this case, since it has to be readable by a driver coming around the curve at 25mph (or more), getting into a narrow turn lane and negotiating a driveway split by an island and with a crosswalk in front of it.  The park's name should be big enough and have enough contrast to be read at a glance.  And not be covered by ivy leaves, which would grow out over the letters the second you turned your back on them :).  Those are good reasons to go with a permanent version of the sign that's there now.  Any lighting should shine on the park's name.  I agree with SusanW about setting the sign back for visibility to exit the park, and also about refreshing the plantings across the island and both sides of the driveway.  Other than the not-legible-enough name, I like the looks of Option #4 the best in general.  A lantern or finial at the top would look more historic (more like the pillar at the corner of the park by Chuckanut Center or like the originals here at the entrance).  I realize these are artist's renderings, but the yellow stucco appearance of #1 and #3 doesn't look anything like Chuckanut sandstone to me, and I like a straight column much better than the craftsman-looking tapered column of #3.  As other commenters have said, #2 looks too much like entrances to malls or condo developments.  If it were built of real Chuckanut sandstone, that might make a difference?  I'm not sure.  The pattern of an entrance sign with a stone facing is very familiar, so the lantern on this one seems oddly and kind of gracelessly plunked there.  When all is said and done, I would favor a short brick column with a hanging flower basket on either side of the driveway, and a standard, very legible park sign on the island.",

Or just the 3% of people like me who like to ride a bike into or thru downtown?   I bike all over town, and I think the changes to Holly Street are incredibly naive.  You've taken THE MAJOR road thru the center of B'ham, that connects the South/East neighborhoods to the North/NW, and reduced it down to 2 lanes, and then 1 lane!!!!!   \r\nLet me say that again, what was once THREE lanes from Ellis to Bay streets is now 1 or 2 lanes.  So you have in effect reduced the vehicle capacity by more than 50%.   I like to bike, but not down streets that are bumper to bumper with cars for many hours of the day.  I much prefer to bike on streets that are NOT a major arterial.  When I have biked down Holly Street in the past, I would prefer to be in the vehicle lanes, riding with traffic and making sure all vehicles can see me.   Now I don't want to bike down Holly Street, The bike lanes are awkward at best, dangerous at worst.   In the past, and now, I much prefer to bike on Magnolia, Ellis, Cornwall, the trail along Whatcom Creek, Railroad, etc., depending on where I'm going.  There are many options for biking.   As a bicyclist, I don't need to be on the same roads that were designed to move motor vehicles efficiently thru an area.   You negatively effected 1,000's of drivers to please a couple hundred bicyclists.  Probably less.\r\nI drive, ride the bus, and pedal thru and near Holly St, you have made all options worse.\r\nI know there are bicyclists that applaud any traffic work that has the work \"bike\" in the definition.  But these bicyclists are only looking at it from their perspective.  A perspective that is only shared by a very small % of the citizens.  More people are not going to bike on Holly St because of the changes.  But you have made driving and riding the bus take longer.  Yes, the bus.  I like to ride the bus too, but now it takes buses longer to get down Holly St.  The money spent on the bike lanes on Holly St would have been much better spent on fixing streets, offering bus service later at night, offering more frequent buses, preemptively replacing the bridge on Electric Ave.   Wow, that whole bridge needs replaced.  The traffic impact of having that street closed is going to drastically impact Woburn, Lakeway, and Alabama.  Negatively effecting 1,000's of drivers per day.  You want to see how 1,000's of people feel about the Holly St bike lanes?  \r\nPut a big banner across the street,  with a very short message asking people to go to a website and give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the changes.   \r\nA rationale and realistic gov't is what the people want.\r\nps, You keep the restaurant dining on the streets so Holly squeezes down to 1 lane??

The problem is the poor visibility for cars turning right from Holly onto side streets. Although there's signage that cars have to yield to bicyclists proceeding straight, it's almost impossible for a driver in the slowed traffic to see a bicyclist coming up behind them on the right, on the other side of parked cars, which can include vans and pick-up trucks that block the driver's view. The provided photo, which has little traffic or parked cars, is not representative of my experience. After an initial run down the bike lane, I submitted my comments to the City, but then thought maybe I overreacted and should try it again. On my second attempt, a large City truck cut me off when it turned right, directly in front of me! I don't blame the driver - as I said, the set-up doesn't provide proper visibility. So be careful if driving or biking, and I hope someone doesn't get seriously injured or killed as the City continues their experiments. For myself, I will avoid driving or biking on Holly.",

    "content": "For those of us that live downtown there is virtually no parking close to where we live. We resort to street parking and rely on the low cost and free weekends to make it affordable to live in the downtown core. I run a business downtown and rely on that low price parking for my clients as well. It\u2019s going to make parking a nightmare since the closest parking garage is far enough away that it\u2019s a nuisance to get there in the rain. Why are we even changing this in our small town? It\u2019s discouraging local shopping, eating, and living by making it less equitable. Those that rely on the current structure will be pushed out of living downtown by all these increases. Our small town vibe is obviously being taken away. I understand the city needs the revenue, but taking it out on those that want to support local in other ways is unfair. I\u2019ll need to relocate my business if these fees continue to rise, when I want to have as accessible a business as possible. Is it possible to prevent these changes from happening? Where do we go from here to prevent these inaccessible changes?",

You're helping to raise the bar for what's public knowledge in Bellingham. You can guarantee the Mayor that when more of us understand the concepts and terminology better, we will have better civic discourse. And you can predict we will make progress faster when we're having well-informed participants in our discourse, looking for harmony or at least for what resonates in a pleasant, considerate way. My question involves terminology: Can we please invent or choose words to replace a few terms that cause disharmony? For example, single-family zoning triggers fights on all sides, and single-family is a complete misnomer, regardless of how often it's used in the BMC.  Fact is, most homes (but not all) are occupied by one family, including all the homes in a multi-home apartment building. Instead of single-family homes, maybe try calling them one-family-buildings or something more elegant than one-family structure. Most of us acknowledge that living in a one-family building is a option and a privilege available only to (usually) those of us who can afford it (or who could afford it when detached homes in a nice, walkable Bham neighborhood cost only three or four times your annual income).   There are other terms that could be updated or made more clear, but I thought I'd start at one of the most disharmonious, outdated, planner terms. As a minor improvement, you could start by encouraging us all to say \"detached homes\" when our meaning does not include attached homes?  Third question, is there a dialogue inside City Hall about what using which planning terminology to use, and if so, can I be part of that? I have thoughts but I'm not an expert  - maybe it would help to call in the neologists  :-)",

The psychology of that process could be shortcut with some public education.\r\n* Many street trees suck. I see a trend of increasing dwarf character in new street trees. Small, slow growing trees provide little urban forest value.\r\n* People will work for their own self interest. I think that would include forestry work close to home such as planting and tree maintenance. The city could facilitate hyper-local neighborhood involvement (volunteerism) and ownership of common forest resources.\r\n* I really don't see why Native Americans are called out specifically in this plan. There are myriad interest groups and I don't see that Native Americans are really much more special than all those other groups.\r\n* Action item 18. Tree Incentive Program: Expensive $$$$$. Trees are often perceived as only a hassle, due to the required maintenance. I doubt that incentives alone will change much. Owners will plant trees themselves if educated about the economic value of trees. Education is more powerful and less expensive than money incentives.\r\n* Action item 30. Urban Forestry department?? $$$$$  This is creating a king with no kingdom. A beaurocratic nothingness.\r\n* Action item 46. $$$$$ Water newly planted trees for 3 years. With correct tree selection and planting, only one summer of watering is needed.\r\n* Action item 47. $$$$ Mulch trees in parks or large boulevards. If a tree needs mulch to survive, it is not appropriate for that site: don't waste resources on it. Give resources to trees that will grow on their own after a short establishment period.\r\n* Action item 35. $$$$$ Expand the City maintenance list to include all street trees. Why so expensive?",

Key example is the BGCC development, which you approved with NO consideration to the many mature trees on the property which will be lost in order to build a few expensive condos. I question whether there will be affordable housing provided in whatever development comes to pass. And planting new trees as mitigation for the 300+ mature trees that will be lost is not an effective solution. We need clear, enforceable city laws to protect our mature trees.",
