Many express concerns about infrastructure capacity, parking availability, and the need for clear, actionable, and transparent planning processes. Opinions diverge on transportation priorities, such as balancing car use with transit and bike lanes, as well as on development scale and regulatory approaches. Safety, accessibility, support for vulnerable populations, and environmental sustainability are widely valued. Overall, residents seek balanced, equitable growth that integrates housing, environment, and community needs.",

Many raise concerns about infrastructure capacity, including transportation, water, and public services, urging thoughtful integration of green spaces and multi-modal transit. There is disagreement over eliminating neighborhood plans and equity initiatives, with some fearing loss of local input and others advocating for more flexible, citywide approaches. Safety, accessibility, and support for vulnerable populations, including the unhoused and elderly, are widely highlighted. Overall, residents seek balanced growth that preserves livability, equity, and sustainability.",

              "text": "As 45-year residents of Bellingham, we've observed three things that greatly contribute to the health and livability of our residential neighborhoods:1) The first is green space. Please require any new construction to leave enough green space with trees, bushes, plants, and flowers for bird and wildlife habitat. New construction in our neighborhood seems to encompass the entire lot, leaving no room for plant or animal life. This makes our neighborhoods less healthy and livable for humans, but also for the plant and animal life that is already here.2) The second is adequate transportation infrastructure (parking, sidewalks, crosswalks, bike lanes, bus stops). Please require adequate parking and other transportation infrastructure with any new construction. We live next to a single-family home that seems to have magically transformed into student housing. There is room for two or three cars at most, but now there are six!! The extra cars are forced to park on the sidewalk, partially in the road, or in front of neighboring houses. I've observed elderly neighbors double-parked just to unload their groceries, then park a block away in inclement weather because there is no longer space in front of their home.3) Lastly, the people that know the neighborhoods best are the people that live there. Please honor existing neighborhood plans instead of replacing them with a homogenous plan that may work in some places, but not others.Thank you.",

I say that as a former member of the American Institute of Certified Planners in another century and another state. My comments are some I would not have made as a young planner, but rather those of a downsizing retiree. I would like to second a previous comment about the need to address noise in Bellingham. The noisy apartments near Interstate 5 are not suitable places to live for many people. The City of Bellingham needs to ask the Washington Department of Transportation to erect berms or walls to deflect sound that degrades the livability of housing in the freeway corridor. The noisy trucks run all night. We learned this the hard in our three month stay in an apartment next to I-5 upon first moving to Bellingham in 2021.We were able to find a much quieter place to live in the Cordata area, but this experience made me aware that this is an impediment to available housing. We had to find places remotely during the pandemic with little direct knowledge of Bellingham.  Why would a retiree downsizing here in Bellingham and thus making a single family home available to a young family leave a spacious and quiet house for a cramped and noisy apartment? For filtering in the housing market to occur all apartments need to be quiet. Furthermore, and now speaking as someone with a total knee replacement more apartments need to be on one level without stairs.  Finally, I may have missed it in the documents, but I believe the City should have a goal for the proportion of housing that meets universal design standards.",

Comment: Most of you are very young still, and you cannot really imagine what it si like to grow older, to rely on a car rather than a bike, to rely on close parking and close services. In all of your youthful excitement over getting rid of parking spaces, and etc. don\u2019t forget the less able seniors and the truly elderly. We still like to get around and have a quality of life. We still contribute economically to the community, eating out, shopping in stores, going to community events, etc. We still may want to live in our own homes and not be shunted off or \u201cencouraged\u201d to downsize into cramped, noisy, and unattractive housing.Now for my question and I would like for staff to give me a brief answer:Recognizing that the Bellingham Plan is mostly guidance (no teeth in it except WA state law) where else is there in the plan city or county legal requirements that will hold developers in check? For the most part they are grasping and will only pay lip service to guidelines in order to make it easy for planning and for the City to okay their nefarious projects.",

We chose a place to live where one parent and children can walk or ride to school and work. The other parent has always carpooled. We still would like street parking to be available when we have visits from guests. When a few properties in the neighborhood consume all the street parking, this is unequitable to those who take care not to. Often infill projects are completed by landlords who do not live in the neighborhood and don't really care about parking difficulties. 2. When choosing streets that are the most bike-friendly for maps, bike lanes, and painting bikes onto, please please bring in bicyclists to give input and to try the routes for extended periods of time. Also, use the most cost efficient ways to do this. Does painting a bike on a street actually work for cyclists in our community or raise awareness by cars? Perhaps. What do surveys say about this? 3. How can we encourage businesses and employers to encourage patrons and employees to use alternative transportation? How about a city-wide initiative like, \"a buck off if you bike\" ... I just made that up, but some businesses (Wander, I think) do this. Great idea. Kulshan does this with Smart Trips. I think only reducing car lanes and reducing parking is short-sighted.

Out in the county, trees are coming down and huge parcels of land are being replaced with mowed lawns and single family mansions. Nobody is constraining this. Meanwhile, the City of Bellingham has many neighborhoods with modestly-sized homes as well as a neighborhoods with huge lots and large homes. If the city treats all neighborhoods with the same rules, then the pattern of the rich maintaining huge lots with huge homes and the rest of the people living in downsized accommodations will continue. More people will move out to the uncontrolled County, and the neighborhoods that become less livable because they are too dense and lack parking will be even less desirable. What do people need? That depends on individual stories and our phases of life. Rentals and communal housing works well for some. Small homes work for others. People with larger families need larger living spaces. The elderly often need in-home care. How can we design our cities to support these different needs.Our parking needs aren't going away, and with the growing adoption of EVs more people need garages with L2 chargers inside.Please consider desirability. If you allow a neighborhood to sell their home to a developer who will tear it down and replace it with a fourplex, will the changes made reduce the value of the homes next door? If you don't handle safeguarding the neighbor from an increase in noise and traffic, it will. This shouldn't be allowed without serious compensation.",

              "text": "Happy Valley, according to prior census data, is one of the largest, most densely populated and most economically challenged Neighborhoods in all of Bellingham. According to the City's website, it also has the highest percentage of multifamily housing, and we estimate %70 of our entire housing stock is devoted to rentals -- there's very little home ownership here -- which historically means that residents are disenfranchised as \"stakeholders\" or otherwise have no vested incentive to engage with long-term planning.Happy Valley has a failing Level of Service for public parks and the most listed instances of missing multi-modal infrastructure noted in the City's Bike/Ped plans -- the entire neighborhood is an engineered automobile slum due to decades of neglect and constant pressure from predatory infill schemes. Furthermore, a long and incoherent history of selling, or \"vacating,\" unimproved Right-of-Ways to developers means that several former public transportation corridors are now completely sealed off and are private property. This trend is ongoing and, in 2021, the City sold a ROW that had a connecting trail, marked on Park Department maps, so a developer could build access to his parking lot. (If you need a more potent example for how disastrous this policy of liquidating transportation easements is, please observe that all 17 acres of the Sehome Village Mall had every route vacated -- it is literally a fortress that repels all access by bicycle or walking, has literally ONE paved sidewalk entry, and should be taught in upper level Urban Planning seminars as an example for how to ensure that everyone has to drive even though, very literally, there are thousands of poor residents living within blocks of the sprawling retail and groceries anchor.)The City's Parks Department has been aggressively dismissive of multiple requests for what are mostly minor trail upgrades -- they simply refuse to engage with us, despite some cases of urgency, and instead keep telling us to \"comment\" on deflectionary digital distractions like this dumb survey: The development proposal at 2706 Mill Avenue is an example of this whereby we cannot get Parks to engage with the planning process despite the very clear fact that the 15 townhomes, if built without consideration of multi-modal impacts, will forever forbid a trail connection linking our only major trail corridor (Connelly Creek Natural Area) to the City's largest Elementary School, its second largest Highschool (Sehome High) and the various students or sports teams that would want to use the route to get to Western Washington University.There are zero sidewalks on this section of Mill Avenue, of course, and then zero sidewalks on the next arterial, Douglas Avenue, which bisects the $87 million Elementary School and the $110 million High School.The project will sail through permitting nonetheless. Happy Valley is a sacrifice zone for crapulous urban planning and density schemes and nobody at all from the City of Bellingham will deign to respond to the very clear economic and social equity factors that indicate, pretty clearly by now, that bias and regulatory capture are fully alive and well for this under-served neighborhood.The City just announced that the new scheme is to jettison all Neighborhood Plans -- toss them in a dumpster -- while simultaneously gutting zoning, parking, and density regulations to cater to the mythology of miracle affordability from salivating developers with no apparent awareness of how rapacious capitalism -- ie: \"the Market\" -- has already created a veal farm for rental profits out of this dysfunctional and struggling area of Bellingham.That's too bad: I'd wager that a mere one million dollars of effort building trail connections here, as outlined comprehensively in the 'Green Infrastructure' chapter of the Happy Valley Neighborhood Plan, would utterly transform this neighborhood and provide some resiliency and long-term adaptation to assuage the trauma of (further) growth here.The claim that we no longer need Neighborhood Plans is prima facie fraudulent. The existence of Greenways, the PMP, PRO Plans, etc., clearly hasn't meant anything for Happy Valley in the past and, conversely, it has ONLY been neighbors literally building or fighting for the infrastructure here, at least in the past five years, that has gotten any progress whatsoever.All those magical cities of ecotopian bliss and connectivity that Bellingham claims to want to emulate? Bend, Oregon, or Boulder, Colorado?They had a vision and stuck with it.Bellingham just has chaos, winners, and, in Happy Valley's case, losers that get ignored.",

Wages do not increase apace with rent, and rent increases every year. Aside from the difficulty of getting into housing, maintaining stability of the housing you are in is difficult when you don't know if you will be able to continue to afford your home when the lease is up. What is affordable when you move in can quickly move out of your budget.The term \"business friendly culture\" sounds like a euphemism for removing unhoused people from view. Downtown is very safe, and unhoused people do not make it unsafe, nor are they responsible for businesses closing. Using unhoused folks as a scapegoat is not acceptable. We are all part of the same community and must care of each other. We need more low/no-barrier shelters, and daytime shelters. Some cities have also installed lockers that allow people without homes to store their belongings safely. We also need more places for people to be that don't cost money! For youth, for adults, for elders, for families. It would be great to have community and recreation centers that give us a chance to build community without financial barriers. I would personally really like accessibility information (grade of the trail, material of the trail, width, etc.) about city parks to be easily displayed and filterable on the website. For great examples of accessibility information, the disabled hikers guide to Washington is awesome.More frequent transit would be lovely, especially in the areas where buses only come every hour. I love the every 15 minute routes!

Why should small operators be paying $2 more per hour than the already highest in the nation minimum wage....to workers that receive tips? How about an exemption for having tipped workers? This would protect restaurateurs and bar/taproom operators from paying unnecessarily inflated wages to workers who are making more than the owners in tips, and leaving nothing for the business. Food and drink in Bellingham is becoming too expensive because of minimum wage and tip pressure.I'd like to see safer and more functional, and more affordable parking areas downtown as well as in the Urban Village areas.

I love the trails as a transportation method that is being used on Railroad. I think implementing these throughways around the city would be an excellent idea! With the ever-increasing interest in WWU by locals and visitors alike, I think expanding the transportation system to accommodate a wide variety of barriers would make the city more attractive to the general public. Being an owner of a hybrid vehicle, I value being able to have the opportunity to charge and use electric power whenever convenient, but the lack of electric vehicle ports, those that get mistreated, and those that are privatized, make it nearly impossible to have this privilege and benefit from it. I would like to see public charging stations with consistent maintenance throughout the city and that surrounding it. To further drive these points, I feel that incorporating wildlife corridors for their safe travels would prevent unnecessary collisions with automobiles and animals. I see resident deer that live in the city limits, wish them well, and encourage others to brake for all sentient creatures. Please improve this city for the betterment of everyone and everything alike, as we are all interconnected. Thank you.",

Bellingham is full of diverse social and economic backgrounds and that will only continue to be the case in the future. We need housing units that can fit the needs of all of those backgrounds. Homes that individuals and families can right size into are extremely important (duplex, triplex, townhomes, live-work, courtyard). Not everyone needs or wants an apartment or single family home. We should reduce height restrictions on the downtown core and other designated urban villages.

The fees could certainly be higher but seem sensible for encouraging businesses. Enforcing standards for accessibility, safety and spacing, depending on the final details, should assuage many of the concerns I've heard voiced. I understand the impact these have on parking and traffic, but to me the more we can keep cars out of the heart of downtown, the better and safer the experience will be for pedestrians and cyclists. For our family at least, the less parking there is the more likely we are to bike, bus or walk.Thank you for your time and consideration.

              "text": "Slide 3:  The commenters stating that the cost to housing choices will be impacted by climate action and that transportation, housing, and land use are \"intertwined\" are absolutely correct.  Recently, many of these subjects seem to have been considered in a vacuum, separate and apart from the plan as a whole, and the deficiencies in that approach, which have plagued plans before, is becoming more and more apparent.  At present, the most glaring issue is the reliance on the Urban Forestry Management Plan, a draft plan, which is supposed to inform many aspects of the plan including housing and climate.  That plan, at present, seems to have stalled yet the implications from that plan when adopted have the potential to derail so much of the comprehensive plan.  Slide 5:  Transportation emissions are a very large consideration for climate planning.  Yet, with the extreme costs of housing in Bellingham, it seems the city fails to realize that poor housing policy has created increased travel from Whatcom's smaller cities and rural areas.  If Bellingham continues to adopt additional ordinances placing new restrictions or requirements on housing construction, the people moving to Bellingham for employment will only add to increased car traffic on the freeway and state highways connecting Bellingham to outlying areas.  This \"drive to qualify\" housing plan that Bellingham seems to have adopted is only adding to transportation emissions.  Likewise, planning for water impacts seems to be lacking.  The Bellingham Water Advisory Board just met to consider the city's 20-year water plan and there was not a single mention of the WRIA 1 (Nooksack) water adjudication.  How is the public to take a water plan seriously when that plan fails to even acknowledge what is likely to be the single most impactful action on water resources in Whatcom County for the foreseeable future.  Will Bellingham be called upon to serve a larger area than just the city?  Will Bellingham's senior water right be necessary to serve rural areas and supplement jurisdictions that have exceeded those jurisdiction's rights?  If the smaller cities are no longer able to accept additional population due to water limits, how will Bellingham plan for absorbing the additional population?  These are very important questions for which there seems to be no plan.  Also related to water, it would appear that the recent park purchase on Samish Crest will have a direct impact on the city's plan to build three reservoirs and a pump station in that vicinity.  Parks have an important climate role, but when the parks directly interfere with plans for water resiliency, it would appear the plan is incomplete.  Interfering with the water construction also has a direct impact on the housing that might be constructed in that area.  It appears the plan also relies on trees for carbon sequestration as well as calling out collaboration with county hazards.  The immediate question, again related to the Urban Forestry Plan, would be to what extent the city's tree/carbon plan impacts and informs the county's wildfire resiliency plans.  Slide 8:  One of the biggest questions from this slide concerns the city's ongoing investment in the Post Point Water Treatment facility vis-a-vis sea level rise.  Even the city's water plan only considers continuing investment for increased capacity at that facility and makes no mention of future siting or detailed plans for resiliency at that plant.  Slide 12:  The plan calls for limiting impacts on \"vulnerable communities.\"  I would posit that one of the most vulnerable communities are those experiencing housing insecurity.  Without shelter, community members become exposed completely to climate events.  One of the single largest contributions to equitably distribute climate resiliency would be to construct sufficient housing so as to make shelter available to our citizens.  Affordable housing located in proximity to services and amenities, constructed with technology readily available at this moment to both heat and cool spaces with little energy, should be easily accomplished, yet over 50% of Bellingham citizens experience some level of housing insecurity.  The single largest contributor to human flourishing in history has been the ability to control our environment through shelter, yet the city continues to adopt regulations and restrictions making the construction of that shelter increasingly difficult.Slide 14:  The plan appears to include a portion related to wild fire resiliency.  What will be interesting is how this policy will \"square\" with increased protection of \"landmark trees,\" trees that nearly by definition are on the last one-half of their life span, the time when disease and declining health are most prevalent.  Moreover, the UFMP's call to increase the city's canopy cover only means that fires originating in the rural fringe of the city pose an increasing threat to flames moving into the city due to the increased tree canopy.  This is why the terms of the UFMP are so important to know before committing to the growth policies in the comprehensive plan.  Slide 15: See comments above on the waste water treatment plant.Slide 16:  Again, it would not appear that the city has adequately considered the impact that the WRIA 1 Adjudication may have not just on increased demand on the city's senior water right as Whatcom's smaller jurisdictions approach the limits of those rights, but also the increased population that will result as those other jurisdictions are unable to accommodate population growth.  Slide 18:  Building preservation is an important goal, but it must come with the recognition that retrofitting existing building to adopt new heating and cooling technology can be very expensive.  Building preservation should consider the need for additional affordable housing and ensure that preservation as a goal does not thwart our desperate need for housing.",

The incorporation of this area would meet many of the city\u2019s goals. The UGA Reserve Area does not impede viable farmland, wetlands, nor does it affect the percentage of tree canopy. Development in the UGA Reserve Area will not run into limitations of building within areas that require the removal of existing trees that are important to our city\u2019s ecosystem. It actually creates an opportunity to expand the city\u2019s goals of increasing the percentage of tree canopy coverage.The city is in desperate need of affordable housing, including rentals and homeownership that fill the needs within a variety of income levels. The Larrabee Springs developments are a great example of consistently meeting many of the city\u2019s goals by creating developments that are green, efficient, and affordable. The incorporation of the North Bellingham UGA Reserve Area into the city\u2019s UGA will allow for expansion within that area and the development of urban villages, which can help to foster healthy neighborhood communities. In order to accommodate the influx of housing within the city and the county, expanded and efficient public transportation must evolve. Our current infrastructure has exceeded its maximum safe capacity as demonstrated regularly by the serious and dangerous congestion in certain areas within the city and around the county. There is consistently fewer parking spaces provided within multi-family developments and within newer housing developments. The Cordata area has a bus station that already connects the Lynden and Ferndale areas. It is only natural to expand transportation services between Lynden and Ferndale via the North Bellingham UGA Reserve Area.",

There are also unique public safety and environmental considerations which each neighborhood is grappling with.Neighborhood residents are best positioned to speak for the future of their neighborhood, knowing as they do the unique characteristics and needs of their neighborhood \u2014 including parks, green spaces, trees around and in developments, and safety infrastructure considerations rooted in historic development (such as inadequate streets, sewer, power).

If large multifamily buildings get built without retail spaces on the ground floor, it will lead to a future where residents of these buildings just take the elevator down to their car, and drive away to shop/eat/drink/socialize. We need to bring opportunities for \"third places\" and small businesses that build community and a sense of place to all developments that get permitted, especially in our urban villages/downtown core, but even beyond. One example is an apartment building (primarily student housing) in Happy Valley. How many car trips have been eliminated due to the corner store on the ground floor of that building? We need to enshrine this feature of ground floor activation as a high priority.Additionally, walking on the sidewalk needs to feel dignifying as a pedestrian, otherwise again, people will just drive. A good rule of thumb as to whether a sidewalk has been designed in a dignifying way is if you were to be driving past and see your friend walking down the street. If the first thought in your head is \"Oh no, their car must have broken down\" then they likely aren't walking somewhere that is designed with pedestrians in mind. We need to design our streetscapes and pedestrian corridors such that this first thought will consistently be \"Oh that's so nice, they're out for a walk!\" .This can be done, I believe in you Bellingham!",

That said, I think there should be a standard of construction that needs to be met, a limit in how many spaces they can take, and maybe a review of how much they are being used to prevent one from become a derelict. Construction requirements should not be so onerous that a smaller place cannot gain an entry to this opportunity. I hope the city will be determined to keep the fees reasonable to ensure that all owners can keep as many of these as they can. I\u2019m not an owner and don\u2019t know any. This is only my preference as a consumer and resident of Bellingham. P.S. on the topic of parking: maybe the city should decide how much is acceptable to give up.

It feels to me that Bellingham does a lot of its planning around where WTA has existing routes. Take, for example, urban villages, which are zoned near existing transit routes. But it should be the other way around - The city should be able to designate certain areas as underutilized and upzone them, and then WTA should figure out how to provide the area with bus service. Also, I'm not sure how realistic the city is being trying to discourage single-occupancy vehicle use. I agree, it would be great to live in a walkable community and rely on bikes to get around. But that's just not practical for lots of people, like those with mobility challenges, children to cart around, or who just don't want to get rained on. I'm in favor of reducing parking minimums, but not eliminating them entirely. It's better to provide positive incentives for doing something other than single occupancy vehicles instead of punishing those who do drive by turning the whole city into a parking nightmare. Another thought - can we eliminate some of the on- and off-ramps to I-5? So much of the traffic and many of the accidents are just from the constant shuffling people do getting on and off. I'd suggest adding an inner lane in each direction, but I don't think that's practical and I'm not sure it would solve the problem. I was always taught (way back when) that the interstate is for longer trips and if you're only going a few miles, it's better to take surface streets, but the number of ramps we have make it tempting to take I-5 even if you're going just a mile or two.",

You've taken THE MAJOR road thru the center of B'ham, that connects the South/East neighborhoods to the North/NW, and reduced it down to 2 lanes, and then 1 lane!!!!!   \r\nLet me say that again, what was once THREE lanes from Ellis to Bay streets is now 1 or 2 lanes.  So you have in effect reduced the vehicle capacity by more than 50%.   I like to bike, but not down streets that are bumper to bumper with cars for many hours of the day.  I much prefer to bike on streets that are NOT a major arterial.  When I have biked down Holly Street in the past, I would prefer to be in the vehicle lanes, riding with traffic and making sure all vehicles can see me.   Now I don't want to bike down Holly Street, The bike lanes are awkward at best, dangerous at worst.   In the past, and now, I much prefer to bike on Magnolia, Ellis, Cornwall, the trail along Whatcom Creek, Railroad, etc., depending on where I'm going.  There are many options for biking.   As a bicyclist, I don't need to be on the same roads that were designed to move motor vehicles efficiently thru an area.   You negatively effected 1,000's of drivers to please a couple hundred bicyclists.  Probably less.\r\nI drive, ride the bus, and pedal thru and near Holly St, you have made all options worse.\r\nI know there are bicyclists that applaud any traffic work that has the work \"bike\" in the definition.  But these bicyclists are only looking at it from their perspective.  A perspective that is only shared by a very small % of the citizens.  More people are not going to bike on Holly St because of the changes.  But you have made driving and riding the bus take longer.  Yes, the bus.  I like to ride the bus too, but now it takes buses longer to get down Holly St.  The money spent on the bike lanes on Holly St would have been much better spent on fixing streets, offering bus service later at night, offering more frequent buses, preemptively replacing the bridge on Electric Ave.   Wow, that whole bridge needs replaced.  The traffic impact of having that street closed is going to drastically impact Woburn, Lakeway, and Alabama.  Negatively effecting 1,000's of drivers per day.  You want to see how 1,000's of people feel about the Holly St bike lanes?  \r\nPut a big banner across the street,  with a very short message asking people to go to a website and give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the changes.   \r\nA rationale and realistic gov't is what the people want.\r\nps, You keep the restaurant dining on the streets so Holly squeezes down to 1 lane??

There are multiple fish barriers as well as an area where a broken bridge sits adjacent to land that has no protection for fish. Dogs play in the waterway, and a bare slope sits adjacent to the water. How about we eliminate that bridge, strip out the pavement, and plant native plants in the area to help with fish habitat? Do we really need another bridge there? We already have one downstream. Plus, since funding is limited, putting a second bridge in this space seems a bit wasteful. We could always set the stage for a newer, bigger bridge for the future, but we should be focusing on the native habitat now. The city of Bellingham Parks Volunteer Program could partner with NSEA, as well as Public Works, to totally recreate that space and have a wonderful native green space habitat for the community to admire and appreciate.

You're helping to raise the bar for what's public knowledge in Bellingham. You can guarantee the Mayor that when more of us understand the concepts and terminology better, we will have better civic discourse. And you can predict we will make progress faster when we're having well-informed participants in our discourse, looking for harmony or at least for what resonates in a pleasant, considerate way. My question involves terminology: Can we please invent or choose words to replace a few terms that cause disharmony? For example, single-family zoning triggers fights on all sides, and single-family is a complete misnomer, regardless of how often it's used in the BMC.  Fact is, most homes (but not all) are occupied by one family, including all the homes in a multi-home apartment building. Instead of single-family homes, maybe try calling them one-family-buildings or something more elegant than one-family structure. Most of us acknowledge that living in a one-family building is a option and a privilege available only to (usually) those of us who can afford it (or who could afford it when detached homes in a nice, walkable Bham neighborhood cost only three or four times your annual income).   There are other terms that could be updated or made more clear, but I thought I'd start at one of the most disharmonious, outdated, planner terms. As a minor improvement, you could start by encouraging us all to say \"detached homes\" when our meaning does not include attached homes?  Third question, is there a dialogue inside City Hall about what using which planning terminology to use, and if so, can I be part of that? I have thoughts but I'm not an expert  - maybe it would help to call in the neologists  :-)",

We have now moved many out of the downtown area and out of the encampment behind Walmart, where are they to go.  Is this addressed in The Bellingham Plan? How are we going to find housing and help for these people?  San Francisco has a plan that addresses some of these challenges, The Homelessness and Supportive program that we should look into.  They have had some problems, ones we could learn from, but they are helping people.  .Along with that idea, one kind of housing that would be cheaper to build is small apartments in higher rise buildings, with elevators.  These kinds of structures that would cost less to build.  When I moved here in late 2020, the motel we stayed in during our first 10 days, had homeless families living there.  If we build more 'high' rise apartments for housing the transitional homeless, we could provide them with a better place to live while they transition, in a more dignified and thoughtful manner...and probably cheaper.  Further along using this approach to building, in all big cities there is little expectation that one is going to have access to home through a ground level entrance.  Why do all homes here have to have that idea.  Those starting out could buy smaller places, located in higher rise buildings, to live in , and later upgrade to larger home. And, possibly, as time goes by, those types of housing might even serve the elderly, when they retire and want to downsize.  Locating these types of buildings near transport and activities would even enhance their appeal.Back to our homeless fellow Americans, we just can't clear encampments or the downtown area and expect these people to disappear in a cloud of smoke.  They are all still here and we absolutely need to have their needs addressed in any new budgets and plans. They need, not just housing, but other support to help them get back their lives. Helping them should be a thoughtful part of any plan this City has.Where in the plan is this addressed?",

On less trafficked streets, it may not be as much of an issue, but they are taking up scarce parking in places like Fairhaven.  Further, it doesn't appear that businesses downtown need a place to expand by the number of vacant commercial spots.  I would have a completely different opinion about this if Bellingham and Fairhaven downtown went completely car free, but also provided free buses or trolleys.

I'm surprised that with the obvious emphasis the city has on making Cordata a walkable, runnable and bikeable location, that the speed limit on the main arterials were left at 35 mph.  All these streets have lots of pedestrian and and bike traffic, but have to contend with fairly fast vehicles, who often go above the speed limit because the roads are broad and no stop signs.  I appreciate that the area adjacent to the park has the special flashing crosswalks, and that really does get driver attention.  But there are many other crossings on the way to those crosswalks where the traffic is moving full speed and not expecting to stop for pedestrians.  I would really recommend bringing the speed limit down to 25mph as is true of most of the streets in Bellingham that have homes either fronting the street or very close.

Almost nobody I have spoken with has heard about this, and it didn't seem to get the publicity that other Engage Bellingham issues such as traffic or tree canopy have.  Somehow, this has been presented as if there were really no choice for the neighborhoods/neighborhood groups.  I would be curious about how many groups have submitted comments and how many of the 90,000+ residents have.      Making a rushed decision could be devastating to the entire city. We are a popular place for people to move, and they are coming.  Why would we make a seemingly rash change to the lovely distinctive character for each area of this city? We have pride in our neighborhoods, and the idea of over-riding these neighborhood groups and the input from the people who actually live there seems completely counter-productive.      Already, the state has thrown neighborhoods into confusion about what they can and canNOT do.  And then there are the ADU's and the freedom to build without offering parking in the city limits. These are already benefits to development/developers. Do we know how these will impact neighborhoods yet, when they've only recently been passed?   It only makes sense to wait until we see what happens in the future from these other changes (on top of the end of single family zoning) BEFORE considering taking even more ability to influence the growth away from the existing residents who will be the ones left living there in drastically altered neighborhoods after this decision (to eliminate neighborhood plans).   Many people have weighed all aspects before renting or buying a home, and that rug should not be pulled out from under them.  There were reasons people rented/bought where they did, and particularly those who have lived in one place for much of their lives, enjoying the place they so astutely chose when younger, are counting on the sense of security that familiarity will bring them as they age.    What looks right on paper, or solves a certain issue, is NOT necessarily the only option and needs to be heavily weighed against all the other options.  This isn't \"draw an option out of a hat.\"  Certainly, there needs to be a much longer public comment period and no rush!  This is a huge change, and the public has been busy dealing with severe weather for a month, not likely to place public input above clearing drifts of snow or staying warm.   In conclusion, I would say this idea feels rushed and somewhat covert...presented at a time that people aren't available and in a way that sounds as if we have no choice.  And yes, I am upset about this process in general and the \"City Plan\" in particular.  Feel free to communicate with me at the email address I will include with this submission.",

It was explained in the meeting that this was a good thing so that a developer that is building something in Cordata or in Fairhaven has the same consistent set of rules. It was also explained that there would be 4 categories of zoning R1 - R4. This sounds great, especially from a developer point of view, until you think of the different neighborhoods and why people move to one neighborhood or another. In the meeting the planning department said that this will make their job easier but that doesn\u2019t make Bellingham a better place to live. Bellingham neighborhoods are one of the things that makes Bellingham great. Bellingham doesn\u2019t have to look like Lynnwood to accommodate the projected increase in population density.

An option to reimplement the trolley system with a similar system like a light rail or intercity rail system would elevate so much of the congestion on high traffic routes. If planned and implemented correctly it would help fix so many of the issues just be removing vehicles off busy roadways. Many of busy streets in Bellingham are already five lanes wide (usually with a median in the middle) which leaves space to have a rail system run through the median of the road as seen of Capitol Hill section in Seattle. Though this would be a very expensive to obtain, it would prove greater benefit to the future. If this option is not viable in the near future, I think it would important to focus on frequency of bus's to neighborhoods that are outside of the planned urban villages. For example services to Sudden Valley, it makes it an almost impossible system to use when a bus comes only once an hour. If frequency were to increase, and more infrastructure surrounding the bus stops themselves were developed it would most likely increase ridership in the area and similar neighborhoods in Bellingham.",

Continuing the single family form just in smaller pieces-a driveway and parking, house maxed out for sites is going to create unlivable and unsustainable environments. Row housing, courtyard condoes and other forms need to be considered rather than the diagrams that show smaller cut up areas that will inevitably have smaller setbacks (no space or more parking in remaining spaces). Owner occupancy also needs to be considered as speculative ownership always results in less desirable outcomes for neighborhoods as profit, not livability is the driving factor. A reasonable example are the 60\u2019s era condoes on N Forest St. This provided secure housing but has not been repeated often. Clustered small housing efforts are also rare but should be pursued on larger lots.

Adoption of regulations and codes which allow and incentivize these types of housing is only the first step.

We believe direct proactive measures are also warranted to bring new communities to the City in a consistent, efficient, timely manner. We strongly support the City\u2019s proposed strategy for re-configuration of the Urban Growth Area (UGA) which seeks to remove areas that cannot bring needed housing into the City\u2019s inventory and exchanging those areas with more efficiently buildable land. This action has been something we have suggested for many years. The City has a much different growth paradigm than it did when the original Urban Fringe Subarea plans were developed over 40 years ago.  We also strongly support the strategy for infrastructure investment which can unlock existing buildable lands within the current city limits and the UGA / UGA Reserve.We agree that new Urban Growth Areas must demonstrate the ability to provide urban levels of development, and a sustainable annexation plan should be in place prior to development. We support the creation of a town center in North Cordata in the UGA Reserve, it will provide a sense of community for the existing neighborhoods and an anchor for the City to the North.

              "text": "City of Bellingham Comp Plan Update ReviewThank you for your work on this important Comp Plan update. The materials offered as review of Comp Plan chapter updates via PowerPoint are ineffective as the content is strictly a conceptual outline. There is no detail to review. These chapters are more closely scoping documents submitted for comment before the actual work is conducted. Although providing the public with opportunity to comment is always welcomed, we question the effectiveness of issuing PowerPoint presentations that only provide a very rough conceptual-level of detail that sumarrizes what the City plans to do. Given that fact, we offer the following comments on both the Climate and Environment chapters.Climate Chapter:Slide 1:The \u201cClimate Chapter\u201d is only a PowerPoint presentation with broad concepts presented but no detailed text. This is not a plan because it is an outline of topics to be fleshed out. A person may agree with the concepts in the PowerPoint presentation, but disagree on how the actual plan text, which has not been developed, is developed. This is a disservice to the public that the City serves. The Comp Plan update and review process should be paused to allow time for the actual chapters to be written so as the public can actually review a plan, not just an rough outline of concepts.Slide 2:It is unlikely that the legislature intended that an outline of topics would comprise a Comp Plan.In order for the Bellingham community to understand the concepts in this chapter and be able to provide effective informed comment, COB needs to provide actual detailed text, not just a power point presentation.We agree that the topic \u201cClimate\u201d is important to the health, safety, and well-being of the community. However, providing a PowerPoint outline as a surrogate for the detail that should be in this chapter is ineffective.Slide 3:If this chapter was fully scoped, it is likely that many additional common opinions would also be listed. \u201cCommon opinions\u201d is a very subjective term. This is an example on why a PowerPoint outline will not replace the need for an actual text chapter.Slide 4:It is difficult to comment on a topic or process that is only outlined at the highest level of generality. The referenced \u201cSummary of Proposed Updates\u201d has even less detail in it than the powerpoint presentation.Slide 5: Planning for climate impacts on water supply will be a part of this chapter, but no detail is provided. There are several landmark research projects and reports that evaluate the impacts of climate change on water supply and should be utilized in addressing this topic. One of the most significant impacts of climate change will be water availability and water supply. Climate change will significntly decrease streamflow in the rivers and streams of the county, which impacts COB water availability and should be taken into consideration in growth-related planning processes.It is good to see the new chapter content will utilize an existing program and source of relevant information on low-impact development. Measures identified as low-impact development will assist in climate change mitigation and adaptation/resilience planning.Slide 7:Slide 7 is missing.Slide 8:Although climate impact mitigation is an important approach to addressing climate change impacts overall, this chapter should also address climate change adaptation and resilience planning as mitigation alone will not be enough to offset such impacts.Another topic area should include heat island effects and heat loading caused by development and the loss of forest cover/native vegetation cover and increased atmospheric temperatures that may not be \u201cextreme weather\u201d, but the new normal.Slide 9:It is surprising to notice that water supply is not mentioned as a specific topic area as such will likely be one of the most significant climate change impacts affecting our community.\u201cExtreme weather\u201d is only part of the issue over weather\u2014the issue is the new normal with continued climate change that should be directly considered. Again, given the gravity of reduced water availability and supply with continued climate  change, these should be a specifically identified topic area to be addressed in the updated Comp Plan. The list of topics seems unrealistically limited given the importance of water supply and other natural resource elements in the context of climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation/resilience planning.Slide 10:No comment.Slide 11:No comment.Slide 12:No comment.Slide 13:The impacts of continued climate change and extreme weather on water availability and supply should be listed as a topic.Slide 14:The issue with wildfires isn\u2019t just smoke and resiliency, but should explicitly include the change in wildfire frequency, intensity, duration, and areal coverage with continued climate change.Slide 15:Given the gravity of the impact of sea level rise due to climate change on all existing shoreline buildings and infrastructure, mitigation needs to be comprehensively spelled out.Slide 16:Congratulations, finally water supply is explicitly listed in this new chapter per this slide. The impacts of cliamte change on water supply may be one of the most significant topics that this chapter should address.Slide 17:\u201cEcosystem resiliency\u201d must involve evaluating existing regulations for effectiveness in promoting resiliency. There is a concern that development regulations, legacy tree ordinance, and the urban forest plan may be at odds. For instance, the City has goals to increase forest cover, yet develoment involving the removal of forest cover may  atoccur at a faster rate than increased forest cover or effective ecosystem recovery. This inconsistency should be addressed in this chapter.Slide 18:\u201cMitigate building emissions\u201d should also address the use of concrete and the high rates of greenhouse gas emissions in the process of producing raw cement and concrete materials.Slide 19:\u201cMitigate transportation emissions\u201d should also include traffic signal sequencing to conserve momentum energies by providing more continuance of travel through intersections as opposed to traffic backups waiting for green lights with engines running. The City does this with Holly Street signal sequencing. Also, hybrid vehicles should be expliicitly itemized in addition to EVs as hybrid vehicles use less fossil fuels and turn off while at a standstill at a stop sign or red traffic signal.Slide 20:No comment.Slide 21:This slide show is a rough and generalized outline and is not a substitute for a comprehensive text chapter. There is simply not enough detail presented to comment on.",

Ideally, I would love to see a combination of #2's large-scale housing and #3's small-scale commercial focus. Mixed-use developments that combine commercial and residential spaces would also improve walkability and connectivity, especially in larger housing areas or suburban settings.Here are my thoughts on each approach:#1 - Expanding urban villages would create more walkable areas, but it seems less likely to resolve the housing crisis we're facing.#2 - Large-scale housing along transit routes would meet demand, but even with better public transport, the increased traffic from larger developments might impact walkability.#3 - Spacing out small-scale commercial areas would improve walkability. However, the lack of focus on residential zoning weakens the plan. It would be more appealing if middle-scale housing were considered alongside commercial growth.",

Many of our local families are being choked out by higher rents, home prices and higher cost for everyday needs. Please consider a community wealth plan when building these new projects. It is easily accomplished with a Community Workforce Agreement (CWA) that has priority hire and diversity, equity and inclusion language in it. Along with a standard living wage that the contractors will need to abide by. If our tax dollars are going to build these projects, the contractors should have a responsibility to create community wealth, so the tax dollars go back into our communities and the people who live in our community. It continues to cycle by creating more tax revenue as folks can continue to afford to live here. More local tax payers earning local tax dollars = Community Wealth. Many cities across our state have been successful with CWA's. I would be happy to share more information.  You will find my contact information below. Lisa Marx(360) 303-9266 Lisamarx67@gmail.com",

The materials offered as review of Comp Plan chapter updates via PowerPoint are ineffective as the content is strictly a conceptual outline. There is no detail to review. These chapters are more closely scoping documents submitted for comment before the actual work is conducted. Although providing the public with opportunity to comment is always welcomed, we question the effectiveness of issuing PowerPoint presentations that only provide a very rough conceptual-level of detail that summarizes what the City plans to do. Given that fact, we offer the following comments on both the Climate and Environment chapters.Environment Chapter:Slide 1:There is very little content to review and comment on in this brief PowerPoint presentation.Slide 2:There must have been many more \u201cmost common\u201d opinions presented during the scoping phase. How did the City objectively determine the most common opinions?Slide 3:\u201cStreamlining the chapter\u201d may be a goal of Comp Plan update, but if streamlining is used to update the Comp Plan, then aggressive incorporation by reference and citations must be used so it is clear that best available science was used to update the Comp Plan. Will there be a Best Available Science technical report companion to the Comp Plan?The referenced \u201cSummary of Proposed Updates\u201d provides even less information than this PowerPoint presentation.Slide 4: An explicit topic area should include streamflow and water supply, which are major determinants of growth allocation and planning. This topic area also supports the other already mentioned topic areas.Slide 5:No comment.Slide 6:There really isn\u2019t any concepts presented in this PowerPoint presentation.Slide 7:\u201cAquatic ecosystems\u201d should include the water availability and supply to sustain these ecosystems and tier to the Climate chapter.\u201cWater quality and quantity\u201d should include the impact of land use on water availability and supply as well as water quality.\u201cCoastal resiliency\u201d should include mitigation of sea level rise impacts.\u201cUrban forest benefits to water\u201d, excellent to include this topic. It seems that the rate of forest cover removal in the City due to development exceeds the rate of forest cover protection and increase, a goal of the urban forest plan.Slide 8:\u201cTerrestrial Ecosystems\u201d. This topic area should include urban wildlife corridors.Slide 9:\u201cNatural Resource Management.\u201d The body of best available science needs to be updated from the current Comp Plan (2016). Lots of relevant science has been accomplished since 2016.\u201cControl invasives\u201d should include requiring job site power equipment to be power washed between job sites to reduce the translocation of invasives.\u201cWRIA 1 coordination\u201d should explicitly include water supply, water availability, and water rights, not just \u201cwater.\u201dSlide 10:\u201cHuman Health and Environment.\u201d \u201cPromote urban tree canopy\u201d, this goal needs to include not just \u201cpromote\u201d, but increase urban tree canopy to offset climate impacts, including the heat island effect.Slides 11-14:No comment.",

Guys, if you personally want it and you have enough strength and health, it is your right. But as a mother of a disabled child, your option is absolutely not suitable for me; for my neighbors, two elderly people who already walk slowly, your option is not suitable; for the majority of people with dogs who want to take them out of their apartments to places for walking, your option is not suitable. You want to increase public transport. Ok. But you forget that a huge number of people go to the mountains, to parks, beyond the bays; people travel around the country. People will not give up cars in favor of buses because there is no alternative here. Having a car for occasional trips is expensive in terms of insurance. Do you want to lock everyone in apartments and leave the means of transportation as a luxury? Let people have a decent life, isn't that what all the progress is for? I am also against the wholesale introduction of electric cars. Let's be honest - they are not yet safe enough and do not have a sufficient resource to be able to drive them safely. Equip enough electric charging stations in the all state (at least), then we can talk about the mass introduction of electric cars. Although I personally do not consider them more environmentally friendly: there are no exhaust emissions directly in the city, but they are in places of production - the climate as a whole does not benefit much from such a rearrangement. It would be better to stop cutting down green areas of our city: because trees absorb carbon emissions. Obligating developers to properly green the territory is a good idea.",

So much much has changed in 40 years. Some of these potential roads became conditions os approval for building in those neighborhoods and due to cost no one chose to develop the affected properties. I know of one portion of an arterial that was formally removed from one neighborhood remains in the conditions for an adjacent neighborhood. The ambiguity of what the connectors should be in the Cordata and Meridian Street neighborhoods and who should pay for them disincentivises some builders. A single plan for all required transportation improvments should be implemented so that builderss can be confident in their project conditions.",

              "text": "I could not agree more with Fix Bellingham's comments.  Nailed it.  We rent in Bellingham. Our last rental belonged to an out-of-state landlord we never met who ended up selling due to \"the hot market\". We could not find housing and ended up in HUD housing through the Bellingham Whatcom Housing Authority. We are grateful for our income-based rent, but find ourselves caught in the conundrum of not having enough money to buy a home in Bellingham and having our rent increased as we try to save money for a larger down payment. We qualify for a mortgage and were approved, but we have not been able to purchase a home in the four-plus years we've been actively trying. We are over-income for Habitat for Humanity and we are a disabled household, so self-build options are difficult / not very feasible for our situation. We've been patiently waiting for something with KCLT; the townhomes were too costly (even with assistance) and we will require a single level home. We made an offer on a property in Point Roberts and backed out, as transportation and COVID made that purchase impossible for us. KCLT encouraged us to make an offer on a home they wanted to bring into the trust, so we rushed to make our offer with KCLT providing approximately 90k in downpayment assistance... The home sold for something like 75k over the asking price. At this point, we would rather just try to buy a home with DPA from the WA State Housing Finance Commission (thank you!) and not be indebted to the COB or KCLT for assistance. There is absolutely NOTHING in Bellingham or Whatcom County for that matter that lower-income, mortgage-qualified, disabled buyers like ourselves can qualify for. Homes in our price range are selling to flippers (developers) and cash buyers. Homes that we can afford are being touted by realtors as cash cows for investors (it actually really hurts to keep reading those realtor posts about the rental income potential on homes we'd like to buy). Our realtor keeps steering us towards condos in Bellingham to utilize the homeownership assistance offered. Buying a condo (or mfg'd home) with an HOA or park lot fee that will increase  - is not our idea of a stable investment that we will benefit from. We did not renew to remain on the wait list with KCLT either as they recently sent out a notice that indicates we won't likely be able to qualify for a home now because of the rising home prices, even with the DPA offered. We should not be in HUD housing - our unit should be for a family experiencing homelessness. Several of the tenants in our complex are \"over-housed\" with one individual living in a two-bedroom unit. Why isn't this being addressed when there are so many people who need housing? As we continue to save to try and buy (likely leaving Bellingham when we can), we continue to face our rent being increased because we're saving. We can't win and we can't escape this situation. I never thought we'd be in this position. I'd rather see a much more radical approach that addresses accountability of HUD property management, more options for lower-income, qualified buyers and rent control. The private development in this city is nothing to be proud of. Every development looks the same. More boxes to cram people in to and the rents are still high. As Fix Bellingham said \"private developers build wealth for themselves and that is pretty much it\". Completely agree. Who is really receiving the DPA assistance and who really benefits from this in the long run? If we accept 40-50k in DPA, then we have to make sure we can re-pay that assistance back when we sell the home. That does not help us to create wealth through our investment. This does not help keep housing costs affordable for the future. We've been eligible for the WSHFC funding for several years now. It would be great to access it and use it to buy a home. We just can't find anything in the COB to buy that we can afford or compete for. When there is nothing in an area for the populations eligible for this assistance to buy, then what good are the programs?",

I am strongly in favor of protecting and planting trees to increase biodiversity and keep this amazing place an oasis of nature. To address the affordability and supply of housing, I recommend a \"mansion tax\" like the one that they passed in L.A. It's a tax on all real estate transactions above $5 million, and the funds are used to pay for 1) affordable housing and 2) programs to prevent people from entering homelessness. I read an article about it today and the funds are already making an impact on people's lives. As a Bellingham transplant, I think I should have had to pay a tax when buying my house, to offset the impact that my moving here has had on housing prices. We could set the threshold lower since L.A. is a much wealthier place with higher home values. Hope you all will consider this!",

(RCW 36.70A.160 and Policy LU-59) Your November 2024 Land Use Chapter Update identifies shifting an area between Bellingham and Ferndale from UGA to UGA Reserve. We identified an open space corridor in our letter dated August 23, 2024 and previously commented that we believe designating it as a UGA Reserve would be inconsistent with the need for a wildlife habitat corridor and connection of critical areas. See attached map indicating an area we believe should be studied for removal from the UGA and designation as an open space corridor.We would like this update to the Bellingham Plan to identify the vision for where growth will go beyond this planning period. For a good example, we turn to Boulder, Colorado where in 1959, the community established the \u201cBlue Line\u201d restricting water lines from being extended into the foothills. Developers found loopholes, so the community passed a sales tax in 1967 to create an open space greenbelt (\u201cGreen Line\u201d) around the community, resulting in over 45,000 acres of open space and 148 miles of trails within the city. Where is Bellingham\u2019s Green Line? Your draft growth strategy appears to break through the Green Line identified in the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan (see attached Open Space Map).  The Open Space Plan clearly identifies open space at the outside edges of the Urban Growth Area, including the North and South Bellingham UGA Reserve areas you are considering adding for urban growth. We have created two maps (attached) which insert conceptual plans from Caitac, USA . Caitac\u2019s proposal would impact designated Open Space Corridors, would be adjacent to Agricultural Lands and Rural Study Areas, and would merge with Limited Areas of More Intense Rural Development (LAMIRDs). Expansion into the UGA Reserve would have less conflicts, but a vision of open space outside the UGA should preclude their expansion of urban development to Smith Road. If Bellingham expands the UGAs, we encourage specific language in the Plan to designate a \u201cGreen Line\u201d where open space or resource lands are permanently protected.",

As a new parent, I was already looking forward to taking my child there as they grow up, and am dismayed to hear that it is not intended to be permanent. It's an inspiring place that encourages confidence and social growth, as well as a sense of identity helping establish Bellingham as a world-class mountain biking town. It means a lot that we would take such central real estate and use it for something so clearly fun and unique. It is truly the vibrant, iconic space that our development efforts should aim to create. Removing this element would make me less excited to be a Bellinghamster: I am asking you to alter the plans and make the bike track permanent.Cheers,Jason",

Utilizing both option 2 and 3 would allow urban corridors to connect the city together in a walkabout manner and give lots of more diversity in housing while still allowing pockets of true quiet single-family homes for those few that want it. Zoning along the corridors would need to allow for a greater diversity in application as well (stores, restaurants, essentials). But option 2 doesn't necessarily help all neighborhood either, which is why it needs to be combined with option 3 so that more people can easily access essentials without needing to drive across town. The people want walk-ability! I think it's important to look at what other cities are doing that are working. Portland is one of those that does it right because there are lots of little urban corridors that connect the city and provide the resources people need while still maintaining quaint neighborhoods for the people that want it.",

Most of the streateries are just downright ugly and detract from the historic structures in both downtown Bellingham and Fairhaven. They also make it difficult for pedestrians to use the sidewalks. What is the point of having stringent design guidelines for the buildings if you allow ramshackle streatries to stand in front of them? The city needs to preserve the historic character of its commercial districts rather than destroy it. I urge you to adopt more stringent aesthetic guidelines for what essentially are outdoor cafes. In fact, the very word \"streatery\" doesn't recognize the permanent nature of these cafes. Their architecture should have to fufill the architectural guidelines that other permanent structures must fulfill.",

Instead, recognize that such planning is what makes Bellingham a poor location for opening and running a business. Zoning and housing regulations have destroyed housing affordability. Minimum wage mandates make it difficult to hire entry level employees. Rather than more economic development planning focus instead on eliminating the current regulatory impediments to development--get out of the way, in other words. Focus city activities on policing, a solid infrastructure of roads and utilities, and other issues rightly within the purview of a city. Create an environment for entrepreneurship and employment without onerous regulation and central planning and the rest will take care of itself.",

Parking is expensive and is a huge drain on resources for little to no investment. Streateries however, especially if combined with car free streets or at least pedestrian centered streets (no downtown street should be without bike lanes or have more than two lanes of traffic) are extremely lucrative, not only for small businesses but for the city itself. For a relatively small fee a restaurant can significantly expand its seating, which then encourages more people to be patronizing downtown establishments and encourages establishments to hire more staff. Particularly in a college town, having a wide range of service jobs is vital. The construction of such buildings also encourages hiring in the construction sector. Additionally, while parking costs the city a huge amount to maintain and brings in no profit, steateries nor only brings in initial fees and yearly fees to the city for a space which the city doesn\u2019t have to pay to maintain it encourages businesses to grow and thus increases their value and the tax revenue they provide for the city. This could then be reinvested downtown to create a lucrative pedestrian centered downtown which rivals much larger cities in terms of cultural development and economic growth. In short, parked cars do not contribute to our shared culture or our economy, in fact they are a drain on our economy, increasing the number of people who shop and work and eat and play downtown is what encourages economic growth and development.",

The problem is the poor visibility for cars turning right from Holly onto side streets. Although there's signage that cars have to yield to bicyclists proceeding straight, it's almost impossible for a driver in the slowed traffic to see a bicyclist coming up behind them on the right, on the other side of parked cars, which can include vans and pick-up trucks that block the driver's view. The provided photo, which has little traffic or parked cars, is not representative of my experience. After an initial run down the bike lane, I submitted my comments to the City, but then thought maybe I overreacted and should try it again. On my second attempt, a large City truck cut me off when it turned right, directly in front of me! I don't blame the driver - as I said, the set-up doesn't provide proper visibility. So be careful if driving or biking, and I hope someone doesn't get seriously injured or killed as the City continues their experiments. For myself, I will avoid driving or biking on Holly.",

I moved here 15 years ago, and while I find there is much to love about this beautiful place, I am continually amazed by, and deeply grateful for the rich artistic offerings it provides.  The amazing thing to me is that local and visiting talent from near and far who work in the arts receive so little support from Bellingham city and county leaders.  Why is this?  Arts bring wealth to us all, through the pleasure, wisdom and thought-provoking experience arts provide; or the restaurants, hotels, shops who benefit from people attracted to our town to enjoy Bellingham arts.Please address this important issue in the Bellingham Plan.

This makes the city a more expensive place to live which is one thing we are trying to control. Even if the city had not grown to bring in more revenue (via new property taxes) our housing values have climbed substantially which, in turn, raises property taxes. This likely does NOT mean that a family is earning more, however, so taxes usually become a heavier burden - especially for people on a fixed income. We should not spend all of this increased revenue on new projects, but should grow our rainy day fund so the city has financial ability to tackle large emergencies when they arise.

It\u2019s going to make parking a nightmare since the closest parking garage is far enough away that it\u2019s a nuisance to get there in the rain. Why are we even changing this in our small town? It\u2019s discouraging local shopping, eating, and living by making it less equitable. Those that rely on the current structure will be pushed out of living downtown by all these increases. Our small town vibe is obviously being taken away. I understand the city needs the revenue, but taking it out on those that want to support local in other ways is unfair. I\u2019ll need to relocate my business if these fees continue to rise, when I want to have as accessible a business as possible. Is it possible to prevent these changes from happening? Where do we go from here to prevent these inaccessible changes?",

              "text": "I'm a small residential builder here in Whatcom. I've built infill houses/duplexes and an ADU in Bellingham, Ferndale and Blaine. I want to comment on missing middle housing.First, although there are needs for housing at all income levels, I believe the sweet spot for missing middle housing is addressing the \"starter home\" that has become almost entirely out of reach. For young couples with reasonable incomes, say two teachers, and maybe plans for children, the traditional, small starter home would be ideal: maybe 1200 square feet, 2 or 3 bedrooms, and a small yard of some kind. This has become prohibitively expensive in Bellingham and really, throughout the county. But middle housing, say a 3 bedroom apartment in a fourplex, or a townhome on a 1500 sq. ft. lot is the perfect \"modern starter home\". It provides enough size, outdoor space and integration into a neighborhood with potentially other families, near walkable, parent-friendly amenities like parks and schools. There is really no other affordable alternative, and without these options, young couples and families may be forced out of the area.Second, as a builder, I firmly believe that TWO of the missing middle categories will dominate, because they provide the greatest value while remaining understandable to builders and mostly easy to build:  townhomes (in groups of 4) and fourplexes.  These two types fit perfectly on infill city lots, especially with alleys, providing a natural division of 4, so that buildings are reasonably sized (width/height) with an opportunity for green space for each.  And while townhomes provide easier ownership opportunities (which is important), fourplexes may even be more critical, as they are a steppingstone into family housing for people who are not ready to be owners. A 2-story fourplex can provide half a floor for each resident (with windows on 3 sides!) and a single common entry, so they look very much like single family homes, making them easy to integrate into existing neighborhoods. Great for residents, builders, and existing neighbors!  The Casa Blanca fourplex at 1800 D Street is a perfect example of something that would fit very naturally in all of Bellingham's urban neighborhoods.  Please make sure that these two types receive ample attention and that you take into account input from builders.  If these houses cannot be affordably built by private builders, they won't be. I would love to be able to build these here in the town I love.",

Mainly full time residents would LOVE more amenities for shopping than we currently have (it's the number ONE thing I hear from everyone I know here, Bellingham has a serious lack of amenities, which means many drive into Lynnwood or shop online, so it's a loss where money could be spent here).

              "text": "Past Council member Knutson stated a councilor could be full time if they attended all of the meetings they are invited to. He personally felt some day in the future our city council members could work full time, but that time is not yet. Perhaps that was true by choice for him while he served, but that should not set expectations for our other council members, nor does it represent the commitment I have experienced from my representatives. Past Councilor Vargas stated she worked full time and more. Before you take Mr. Knutson\u2019s word that it is part time, please talk to current councilors who take the tasks we elected them to do to heart and are committed to work full time and more to meet the needs of our community. You have the ability to recognize the time commitment of the tasks at hand with your salary determination. I believe now is the time to recognize Bellingham needs full time representation, and I think many of the current council members have been stepping up to meet that need.  I live in a neighborhood where two of my city councilors regularly attend our meetings and events. Between my neighborhood and my partner\u2019s, of which I also attend their meetings and events, I have seen Councilor Anderson and Councilor Lilliquist five times in the past two months. At one event, Councilor Anderson talked with seven of us at length to fully inform us on the issues the city has faced with security. She was also very informative about Post Point. She listened to our concerns and addressed our questions very well. She offered to meet with my partner and I for coffee or lunch to discuss a few concerns we brought up. I looked across the event and saw Councilor Lilliquist interacting with small groups for an extended time too. I assumed all councilors were this engaged.To be engaged and responsive takes time and commitment beyond just showing up for 24 official council meetings.  I should note that although Mr. Knutson attended 24 last year, a little digging showed this year council has added four town halls, and four additional meetings for budgets. That would make it thirty-two official council meetings.   Additionally, you should count the time and effort required to serve on 5-8 boards and commissions each one attends (or should) to represents the city and council. A list who serves on what boards is on the city webpage. Additionally they chair one council committee and service on two others. I want my city council to attend neighborhood and community meetings to meet with their constituents to listen to concerns and inform us on their work. We need councilors to not just show up on council days having skimmed their packet and stamp through what staff have presented. All of these meetings and events that Mr. Knutson felt was optional, should be part of our expectation and their compensation. Being present at neighborhood meetings and community events is a crucial way we connect with those who represent us. Councilor Anderson has eight neighborhoods in her ward: W.W.U., York, Sehome, Downtown, Puget, Happy Valley, Samish and South Hill. Councilor Lilliquist  has six: Samish, South hill, Happy Valley, Fairhaven, South, and Edgemoor.  Councilor Martins has all 27. To be representative of their wards, they should be expected to attend our meetings when they don\u2019t conflict with other duties. When looking at salaries and what is fair, please do not look at this as just a part time position because one past councilor thinks that is the effort needed or what he chose to put in. I don\u2019t blame him for not working full time due to the compensation level. Times have changed and our city has grown a lot over the past 20 years.  Please talk to the current councilors to see how much effort they put in and who is introducing their own legislative work (I can think of Anderson, Lilliquist, Hammill, and Huthman over the past two years).  A strong council spends the time needed to introduce their own legislative work and not just respond to staff\u2019s work.  How will you compare that to other city\u2019s councilors who do not do this work? I appreciated one of the commissioners acknowledgements of what do councilors give up (sacrifice) to be taken into consideration. They are always council members when they go to the store, attend an event, or go to the park to relax. I imagine they are approached a lot on their own time. How will you measure this and take that into account?I ask that you expand your comparatives to include other legislative bodies like the county salary commission did. They looked at state legislator\u2019s compensation. Also look at our county for a comparative. You are looking at what legislators make and should not compare just city to city but look at what is unique in our local community. We have issues that may be similar to another city, and yet we have many that are not: Lake Whatcom, disproportionate houseless, Post Point/environmental, budget responsibility (compare city budget numbers vs. just city population size), jail capacity, fast population growth, housing shortages, etc. I would like you to consider an additional wage for Council President, Mayor Pro tempore, and Council President Pro tempore. Each role takes extra time and effort. Also take into consideration the spread between a mayor\u2019s salary to council. If one comparative shows a councilor makes $2,500 a month and the mayor makes $3,000 that is vastly different than $2,500 to $16,500. The mayor\u2019s salary goes up to maintain the 5% above the top wage. I believe when the new Chief of Police negotiated a higher wage, the mayor\u2019s salary and a few staff had a very large adjustment this year. City staff are compensated for their increase workload, responsibilities, and competitive market, and yet we neglect to acknowledge that for our council for years. We are a fast growing city. What will be your threshold to say when a council should be compensated a living wage for full time work- especially if a majority can demonstrate they are working at that level to keep up with our community needs? Do we want to tell them we expect them to work less?Ask how many cities are currently conducting a salary commission review.  A simple search produced several for 2022- which may be comparable cities based on population. Make sure your comparable are not in review that has not been completed. Take into your consideration of the cost of living in Bellingham. Yakima the average house price is $349,000 (Redfin) and in Bellingham it is $635,000 (Redfin).  The average household income in Yakima is $48,000 and in Bellingham it is $56,000- of which I am sure that data is skewed lower due to being a university town with a large PT student employment population.  A three bedroom house in Yakima can be rented for $1,950 yet in Bellingham it would cost $2850. Ask how many e-mails our City Council receives a year.  We have several past city leaders on this panel, and I am sure the technology alone has changed dramatically since they served or started (access, outreach, and time commitment) over the past ten year. Do not take this as a cost-of-living adjustment. Washington State, of which I am employed, will conduct reviews and when a job is out of line with private and public sector or their tasks have adjusted over time, they will provide a wage adjustment to fit the responsibilities.  These wage adjustments are not part of a cola.  The example of one city raising the wage by 17% and unions wanted the same was a concern for me. To indicate that this body cannot go up above 17% due to unions, was not appropriate.  This should be about a fair wage for the work they provide and not a cost-of-living increase. Whatcom County raised their council salary almost 100% last year. My partner is a union member with the county, and I heard no complaints about employees needing a 100% cost of living increase. I am sure our city employees are intelligent enough to know the difference. Additionally, you should also consider how much support staff a comparable has to assist council with communications, e-mails, meeting set up, outreach, research, etc.. If Bellingham has two staff compared to six, that means there is more work our council needs to preform without assistance. I have written a lot. I appreciate you reading this. You may wonder why I have a strong opinion.  When I moved here ten years ago, I got involved in my community. At one time I thought about running for office, since I had served as a commissioner in another state. I was compensated as a wage for my work. The city was not that much larger than Bellingham. I was shocked several years ago to learn how paltry the compensation is for our council in Bellingham. Why would anyone want to run for office and be compensated so low? How many people like me decided they could not afford to do this job? I can not imagine the lack of work/life balance some of our councilors must have when they also work full time jobs to pay the bills. The days of serving in an office for a town of this size as a sense of duty needs to be done away with. It is patriarchal and is based on privilege.  We need to pay our civic leaders a livable wage and recognize this is a job. It is no longer a feather in the cap to mark one\u2019s altruistic propensity.",

Opinions on bike lanes and streateries vary, with some praising safety improvements and others worried about traffic and parking. There are calls for fair compensation for homeowners, better city responsiveness to public input, and more equitable pay for council members. Environmental preservation and cautious development to protect natural spaces also emerge as shared concerns.",

We elect our officials, and we can choose to elect different ones -- the quality of our current cohort is something we're all accountable for.Some thoughts on how pay should work:1. It's not fair for the Mayor to make nearly $200k, while Council members make closer to $30k.  *Especially for those concerned about political outcomes (I see comments on safety, housing, etc. in the comments others have left already) -- a strong check-and-balance is important.  If we left the Mayor's salary where it is, then the council members, working part-time, should earn half of what he does.  They certainly put in the hours.2. Council Members should, without question, be paid.  Ajw -- you're right that serving is a privilege; but it should be accessible to any and all members of our community, not just those wealthy enough to work for free.  If we want council members who can be as committed and available as we think they should be, let's make this a real \"job\" in terms of pay and benefits so that we don't have to compete with other jobs they may hold for their time.  And, frankly, it's also about respect and acknowledgement as well.3. I would love to see consideration be given to making council member seats a full-time option.  The \"part-time\" fallacy is a heavy lift for the part-timer, who ends-up having to work for free in order to keep up with full-time demands; or else triage which issues they have time to work on, and which they don't.  Also, the PT fallacy ends-up putting more power into the Mayor's seat, as he has more time than council-members do to devote to issues, and we get a lot less return on our investment when we lose that invaluable check-and-balance capacity.  We need a fully-empowered legislative body in Bellingham -- we just have way more going on than we did when these PT positions were decided on way back when.",

There is support for affordable housing partnerships and concerns about urban sprawl, with calls to build up rather than out. Many highlight the importance of preserving native habitats, increasing accessible parking, and creating inclusive community spaces. Opinions diverge on transportation priorities, with some opposing bike lane expansions and others advocating for sustainable policies. Overall, residents seek balanced growth that supports social, environmental, and economic wellbeing.",

Concerns include potential negative impacts of relaxed zoning, parking reductions, rising utility costs, and safety issues from recent traffic changes. There is interest in diverse housing options, cultural inclusivity, and community amenities like food forests and public gathering spaces. Opinions diverge on climate policies and utility management, with some skeptical of environmental measures and others advocating for renewable energy and equitable cost distribution. Overall, residents seek balanced development that supports quality of life and affordability.",

Strong zoning allows home owners to enjoy a quality of life while protecting their single biggest investment. Bellingham's proposed 'open zoning' will wipe that out, condemning any area to frat house lifestyles.  Climate mitigation measures are not needed and accomplish nothing except taking money from hard working people. There is absolutely NOTHING that City of Bellingham can accomplish with Carbon Fuel bans or limits on personal automobiles that will ever result in a measurable decline in atmospheric CO2, however such measure will ensure the poverty of many citizens.  The earth's climate has always changed, there are much greater influences than greenhouse gases,  and man made contribution is a fraction of a percentage of greenhouse gases, less than natural occurring variations.  All of this is easily verified.  If the millionaires who are promoting global warming myths were sincere, they would not be locating their personal residences on the ocean front .",

(Read about Luxury Beliefs, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/campus-protests-progressive-henderson.html.)  I understand that space for parking costs money.  But so do kitchens.  Do we say that poor people don't need kitchens--they can just eat fast food?  Or cook with a microwave and a tiny fridge?  Make kitchens optional?  No, we consider kitchens essential so we can cook our own food more cheaply than eating out.  And poor people need parking so they can have access to a car, take their kids to day care, and work two\u2014or three--jobs.  My son rented a one-bedroom with his girlfriend and of course they had two cars, since they worked in different places.  But their apartment building only allowed one parking space per unit; one of them was always hunting for parking in the surrounding neighborhood.  Let me just say that parking is already a problem for the working class.  Let's not make it worse.",

People on fixed incomes will quickly become homeless in the face of a $300+ increase, a cost that could reach $600 a month--for utilities alone! Forget the price of eggs!

Many emphasize the need for expanded recreational facilities, such as additional pickleball courts, aquatics space, and more diverse park amenities, while also calling for better maintenance and enforcement regarding cleanliness. There is a shared desire to elevate arts and culture as a key community priority. Concerns arise about parking policies potentially harming downtown businesses and some resistance to recent street design changes affecting safety and accessibility. Opinions differ on housing regulations and transit improvements, with calls for more flexibility and enhanced public transit options.",

We play at least 3 times a week through the Bellingham Pickleball Club.  The game is off the charts in popularity for good reason, it's fun, challenging, accessible, and enjoyed by every age group.  The need for more courts, and more importantly lighted covered courts, so play may continue through our long Winters is imperative.  Cordata Park courts are timely and welcome, thank you so much for these!  Other than encouragement for more Pickleball facilities in general my wife and I ask specifically that Pickleball courts be installed at the new Squalicum Creek Park where the baseball diamonds are now being completed.  As this particular park has been developed with a third baseball diamond, further closing it off from general use so that it is less usable as a neighborhood park and now another fenced off baseball field, we feel that it is time to balance out the park with the addition of uses more people in the community want.  In addition to covered Pickleball courts, beach volleyball courts are sorely needed and would get a lot of use.  I'd like to add that it is our opinion that the more a park is used the safer it will be (much as what's happened in Cornwall Park with Frisbee Golfers and Pickleball players being there).  And, last but not least, the Cordata park is beautiful, thank you all for your good work there!",

Please consider placing Arts and Culture more prominently, consistent with its vital importance.There seems to be an important omission in the Plan. Rather than having its own Chapter (as does Parks, Recreation, and Open Space), Arts and Culture has been placed in the \u201cCommunity Wellbeing\u201d Chapter. The category \u201cArts and Culture\u201d does not appear to be represented in key places on the Engagement Hub, most importantly, 1) Graphic on the landing page: engagebellingham.org/hub-page/bellinghamplan, 2)  Scope of Work, especially in \u201cbuild upon what is valued today.\u201dI am always amazed at the variety and talent of the many artists in this area. For its size, Bellingham has an unusually strong cultural center represented by live music, from pop to classical; live theatre of all sorts for all ages; film arts (growing considerably); a wide range of graphic and visual arts; and literature, including novels, non-fiction, film and television. Bellingham also hosts several unique and nationally known film festivals and music festivals. It is home to a distinguished multi-screen \u201cart house\u201d film theater, film production companies, several small theaters doing original work, an extraordinary local symphony orchestra, and distinguished choral groups. Our major arts institutions are thriving: Mount Baker Theatre, Whatcom Museum, Allied Arts of Whatcom County, and the arts departments of Western Washington University, to name a few. There are countless Bellingham citizens who act, direct, produce, write, design, photograph, film, paint, sculpt, and otherwise make art in and for the public, often in public places.Many local corporations sponsor arts programs and use the vibrant Bellingham scene as part of their recruiting process for new employees. Our rich cultural scene remains a huge attraction for corporations that move here.Fostering the arts, enabling them to thrive, and promoting individual creativity in our community increases opportunities for artistic expression and for the awareness of our many cultures.  We need the arts for our community\u2019s wellbeing. We need the arts to promote tourism and its economic benefits. We need the arts to help the Downtown thrive and to increase the general pride with which both residents and visitors view our community. This is a continuing challenge for all cities.We respectfully ask that you to consider moving Arts and Culture further up on the Plan\u2019s priority ladder. Perhaps it needs to be its own Chapter, rather than sitting on one of the shelves of \u201cCommunity Wellbeing.\u201d And perhaps the very broad collective efforts of our impressive arts community be an all-encompassing mission and vision of its own.",

While preservation is often framed as a sustainability strategy, in practice, it frequently serves as a barrier to necessary climate measures and housing production.Older buildings were not designed with modern energy efficient systems and approaches. Upgrading insulation, windows, HVAC, and roofing can reduce energy in existing buildings, but may alter the historic nature of the structure. Additionally, it may be more cost-effectively retrofit old buildings to meet building efficiency standards, let alone other considerations related to floodproofing and seismic retrofitting. Historic preservation ordinances frequently limit energy-efficiency upgrades such as double paned windows, solar PV, or other desirable climate measures that could be considered incompatible with historic character. In many cases, historic preservation serves as a tool to block new development rather than a genuine effort to protect historically significant sites.Preservation policies that lock in existing land uses can also hinder urban densification, which is critical for reducing car dependency, expanding public transit, preserving green space, and preventing sprawl. These land use constraints also have significant implications for housing production and affordability, as discussed in other chapters of the Comprehensive Plan.While arguments about embodied carbon are often used to justify preservation, these benefits must be weighed against the long-term energy inefficiency of aging buildings and the opportunity costs of restricting denser, lower-carbon development. Policy C-31 should better reflect these trade-offs to ensure that preservation and reuse of old buildings and climate action work in tandem rather than at cross-purposes.",

Flexibility is important when land is analyzed, and assessed, and potentially deemed unfit for certain purposes. So we can't limit or bind our uses of certain lands simply due to a prior designation. Perhaps more specifics and rules regarding \"only allow annexations when annexation plan analysis is completed and sustainable.\" Land should be maximized in its use, and that maximization must begin with the land's raw state/condition. This would lend to \"financial sustainability\" and could lead to environmental benefit/sustainability. Not forcing urban development on land with poor bedrock, water analysis, flood risk, etc., makes sense from either financial or environmental perspectives. In addition to considering an areas utility for urban development, we must develop areas to maximize their environmental benefits: improve water flow/retention, prevent erosion, improve keystone growth to establish and maintain thriving ecosystems.",

Even more so in this case, since it has to be readable by a driver coming around the curve at 25mph (or more), getting into a narrow turn lane and negotiating a driveway split by an island and with a crosswalk in front of it.  The park's name should be big enough and have enough contrast to be read at a glance.  And not be covered by ivy leaves, which would grow out over the letters the second you turned your back on them :).  Those are good reasons to go with a permanent version of the sign that's there now.  Any lighting should shine on the park's name.  I agree with SusanW about setting the sign back for visibility to exit the park, and also about refreshing the plantings across the island and both sides of the driveway.  Other than the not-legible-enough name, I like the looks of Option #4 the best in general.  A lantern or finial at the top would look more historic (more like the pillar at the corner of the park by Chuckanut Center or like the originals here at the entrance).  I realize these are artist's renderings, but the yellow stucco appearance of #1 and #3 doesn't look anything like Chuckanut sandstone to me, and I like a straight column much better than the craftsman-looking tapered column of #3.  As other commenters have said, #2 looks too much like entrances to malls or condo developments.  If it were built of real Chuckanut sandstone, that might make a difference?  I'm not sure.  The pattern of an entrance sign with a stone facing is very familiar, so the lantern on this one seems oddly and kind of gracelessly plunked there.  When all is said and done, I would favor a short brick column with a hanging flower basket on either side of the driveway, and a standard, very legible park sign on the island.",

I suspect it takes a lot closer to full time hours rather than part time. In order for this position to be feasible for poor and working class people, whose voices we need most in government, the compensation must include at least a living wage. I encourage the commission to make an honest assessment of the hours required, determine a true living wage* for Bellingham and then consider that the absolute minimum. *Some food for thought when determine a living wage. This recent Herald article says you need to make $61,000/year to afford rent on a two bedroom apartment. https://amp.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article264066621.htmlThis MIT project takes a more nuanced approach, breaking down living wages for different family structures. According to their Whatcom County numbers in a two adult (both working), two child household, a living wage for each adult would be $23.54 or $98,000 total household annual income. A living wage for a single adult, one child household would be $32.80 or $68,000 annual income. https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/53073The city defines a living wage for some employees and contractors to be up to $16.47 which works out to be $34,000/year. This seems much too low to be a truly living wage. https://cob.org/services/business/purchasing/living-wage",

We need more Pickleball courts in Bellingham though! 8-10 courts at Cordata would be awesome. If it's possible to cover them and have lights that would certainly add to the hours they could be used. I think it's time to turn some of our local tennis courts into Pickleball courts too. People of all ages and abilities are coming to this game and Bellingham could be a real leader if we had more courts to meet the ever growing need for places to play. Many thanks for reaching out to the community and for building more Pickleball courts!",

Plastic is well-known to be harmful to people, other animals, and plants, and recycling is not a viable strategy to substantially reduce plastic production (less than 10% of plastic is recycled). Through stronger waste management regulations and collaborations with local businesses in the city and county, Bellingham should work to support alternatives to plastic wherever possible, as well as advocating for state-level support for the same purpose.",

              "text": "I appreciate all that has been done to provide pickleball courts with the Cornwall 6 and look forward to the expansion of our sport through new courts at Cordata Park. Pickleball promotes and supports an active lifestyle, physical/mental health & well-being, exercise and fitness, sports tourism, and economic impact. These benefits are being experienced in cities throughout North America, where pickleball is the fastest growing sport.  I know from personally speaking with and playing with players that pickleball  has literally been and continues to be a lifesaver during the pandemic for the social connections it enables people to have through outdoor play. I could give you a \u201cRah, Rah, I love pickleball\u201d commentary because I am indeed a pickleball fanatic; however, as the USA Pickleball ambassador for Whatcom County and a former coach in a major sport, I hope the following will give specific and substantial support for why I believe Bellingham can and must do \u201cbigger and better\u201d when it comes to pickleball.  This approach might better serve Bellingham in an overall way, particularly economically.  \u2028\u2028Bellingham has a population of 92,314 (of as 2019), more than 4 times the population of Griffin, GA. (population 22, 813 (as of 2019).  They built a world-class facility (Spalding County Pickleball Complex in Griffin, GA) with both covered and uncovered courts which you can see in a review at  https://pickleballrocks.com/2019/09/how-to-layout-the-perfect-pickleball-complex-or-venue/.  This review by Rocket (unbiased as he has nothing to do with the facility) explains \u201cHow To Lay Out The Perfect Pickleball Complex or Venue.\u201d There is a video within the article where he takes you through the facility, pointing out its attributes.   \u2028\u2028The following will give you an idea of the impact of pickleball on that community. I would suggest that we have much to gain in all the above stated benefits should we work together to expand our commitment for pickleball in Bellingham.  Again, the economic benefit alone is undeniable. \u2028\u2028Spalding Co Pickleball Association (SCPA) reaches well beyond Griffin-Spalding County as reported by by Peter Phelps, SCPA President \u2028Consider the following: \u2022 Our facility is a world-class pickleball complex. We have been rated (by tournament directors, players, and pros) as one of the finest pickleball facilities in the nation. \u2022 We were in the March/April 2017 national Pickleball Magazine (a feature article about our extraordinary facility). \u2022 In 2017, we had four tournaments at the Spalding County Pickleball Complex, even though the facility was not completed until late August 2017. \u2022 In 2017, we partnered with the USAPA to host one of their regional tournaments (one of eight across the country) and we partnered with the Super Senior International Pickleball Association(SSIPA) to host the World Championships. \u2022 The Spalding County Pickleball Association just completed a very successful year (2017) at the Spalding County Pickleball Complex in Griffin-Spalding County, Georgia. We had four tournaments in 2017, with the total number of players at 932 (an average of 233 per event)! In every case, we exceeded expectations in terms of participation. The GA State Games and the USAPA Atlantic South Regional (at least) doubled participation from the prior year (at other sites). The Doc Holliday Shootout exceeded our intended cap, and was a great number for the first time out of the box, in the hot month of August. Please note that the GA State Games and the Doc Holliday Shootout were held while construction was still going on ... quite a feat! The SSIPA World Championships was also a first-time ever tournament, and despite being up against the Huntsman World Senior Games in Utah, it drew a remarkable number of participants. \u2022 In 2017, 26 states were represented in our two majors; approximately 40% of our participants were from Georgia; over 50% of our Georgia participants were from the Atlanta Metro area. \u2022 In 2018, we have six tournaments scheduled (most venues have no more than two per year), including two state-level offerings and two majors by the SSIPA and the USAPA. We are also in the process of negotiating for the World Team Pickleball \u2014 Sectionals (leading to the National Championships). We expect to break records, again, in terms of participation. Thousands of people will be visiting our facility. \u2022 We are having a genuine economic impact on our community. We expect that to generate over a million dollars of economic impact by the end of 2018. The Georgia Department of Economic Development says that Pickleball is a Game Changer for sports tourism and economic impact in Griffin-Spalding County. \u2028\u2028Perhaps this report from Lincoln, Canada will also be of benefit to your planning. https://uwaterloo.ca/work-learn-institute/sites/ca.work-learn-institute/files/uploads/files/real_thing_pickleballs_report_2019_al_2.pdf\u2028\u2028Thanking you in advance for taking the time to assess the value of these resources in determining the future of pickleball for Bellingham.",

With cost of living increasing in the area, the growth in population and the strategic initiatives that the city will need to accomplish over the next 5-10 years, will require commitment and the right talent. Because there are no 'experience and knowledge' requirements to be voted in it's difficult to set a bar that high. In the simplest terms, higher wages would allow for more competitive talent to consider leaving higher paying jobs to become a councilor and give them the ability to focus on their work rather than the need to take a second job.We need to be able to bring in the right people, capable of making complex decisions, build bridges and collaborate with others easily should we want to see Bellingham thrive for years to come. Elizabeth call me!",

When compensation does not equate to workload it is extremely difficult to retain, let alone attract competent, capable, and responsible members of our community to step forward, put their personal lives on hold, and dedicate themselves to public service.  I've heard the argument that people should just want to serve our community willingly and not seek compensation.  The only people that can provide that kind of service free of charge or at such low compensation rates currently provided are those that already have a middle to upper class income.  These people do not represent the interests of the general community members.I strongly encourage the commission to recommend fairly compensating these dedicated public servants we've elected and who we look to for leadership in directing our community into a future that is beneficial to all our members.",

              "text": "What does our Mayor make per year? In 2021 the salary was $174, 254. Our council made $28,753. If you divide the councilor\u2019s salary by 40 hours (full time) and 52 weeks, that means they made $13.82 an hour. Washington state minimum wage for 2022 is $14.49 an hour. I heard staff state that City Council members are not necessarily full time, and yet a councilor pointed out that their weekly timesheets are marked for 20-hour weeks and medical benefits are at a part time rate coverage for spouse and family- they would have higher costs to cover family than a full-time employee.  When you look at all the boards, commissions, events, and meetings they are to participate in, that alone is more than part time work. Add to that the accounting for large complex packets to be read, research, inquiring and receiving community feedback, meeting with neighborhoods, special interests, and individuals on top of e-mails/phone calls it can easily fill up a full-time week if not more.  I have met with a few councilors over the years, and they have expressed this is a full-time job, but many must work other jobs because they can not live making below minimum wage.  The county\u2019s salary commission did the right thing and acknowledged the work our county councilors do. They moved their wage from $31,243 in 2019 to $56,881 in 2022 and set a cola where in 2023 they will be paid $58,246 a year ($28 an hour).  Our city councilors should not earn any less for their work and responsibilities. Our city has grown and will continue to grow. We have big city issues our councilors are addressing. We need to recognize we are not a small town and should not compensate at a small-town level. The old adage that you get what you pay for is at least partly true. At such a low wage, the only individuals that can afford to do the work of the city and for our community are those who are retired, a second wage earner to a primary wage (keep in mind they don\u2019t make state minimum), or those willing to work two jobs and give up any semblance of a work-life balance. What our community has been receiving is skill, dedication, and a high-performance level that we are truly not paying for. This is not sustainable nor equitable going forward. In the past six years, we have had two (single) women councilors step down due to having to move out of town for livable wage work. This is an equity issue we need to address. Gone are the days that we can expect highly competent individuals to work for free. It is time we pay our city councilors a respectful wage that demonstrates equitable pay to their county peers and  respectable living wage for the level of work they perform.",
